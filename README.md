# Line Encoder and Scrambler 
## Objective: 
### Implement Line coding encoder and scrambler with digital data generator.

- #####  Asks the user to either input the digital data or to input the length of random digital data to be encoded.
- #####  Line coding schemes to be implemented: NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Dif- ferential Manchester, AMI.
- #####  Scrambling schemes: B8ZS, HDB3.
